MyLibrary is a Web app hosted on node.js using Express.js.  It's an app to track the books I've lent out 
to people.  Plus it's practice for html5, css3, mongodb, and javascript.

6/1 - Fixed some of the css for adding a book.  Added search page.
6/2 - Added functionality to pull title and author from isbndb.com and populate the add form.
